i dont even kno what an advent is but here are my sols for advent of code  
so ill just post my solutions here (in python)

ok so my solutions are categorized base on the genre  
for example, intcode challenges and maze problems are both in their own little folder, along with a module that packs all the functions and classes i used  
the miscellaneous problems are outside of all folders, and just in bad_solutions
